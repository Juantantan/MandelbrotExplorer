# Mandelbrot explorer with OpenGL/OpenCL Interoperability
![Screenshot](/docs/images/rm-2.png)
Mandelbrot explorer uses OpenGL/OpenCL interoperability to leverage the raw compute power of OpenCL with the display
capabilities of OpenGL. The codebase will work in Linux, Windows and MacOS. Mandelbrot explorer renders colourful, 
detailed images from pixel maps formed by iterating through the Mandelbrot algorithm and 'shading' each pixel based on the
number of iterations each pixel coordinate value in the real and imaginary planes takes to escape the mandelbrot set.
You can zoom in and out with Mouse L + R. You can alter the 'kernel' file, which is written to your Graphics hardware 
(GPU / CPU /...) during compile. User interaction (zooming) is done via the 3rd party SDL2 library.

At the time of writing, there was little to no open source code available on the web which demonstrated OpenCL/OpenGL
interoperability. This is important because it's all very well producing an image map but displaying it to screen has
to be done to enjoy the image visually. There aren't very many OpenCL offerings when compared to OpenGL and very few which
combine the two APIs. These Interoperability offerings are mostly just code snippets in reference articles.

## Mentions and thanks
### Eric Bainville
A few years after processor only VB and C# versions were written, I did a search on rendering the Mandelbrot set and how
others had done that. I stumbled upon the excellent and extensive work done by Eric Bainville. My initial implementation
using OpenCL was based on Eric's work. Without that, which formed the central core of the OpenCL part, I probably would
not have been able to do anything more. To see Eric's work using OpenCL and other projects, his homepage is here: 
http://www.bealto.com

### Mark Brown
When I got a recent version of this software to run some years ago, I passed a copy to Mark and he was kind enough to go 
through it and offer advice. In particular, he tidied up my poorly executed OpenCL error-handling method and sent that 
back to me. He also commented on various aspects of what the code was trying to do and opened me up to other languages
and techniques, such as functional programming. Mark has written web guides for using Erlang, OpenGL with Lisp, 
Ray-tracing, OpenSSH, encryption and security, as well as articles on many other specialised subjects. 

## The Mandelbrot set
To understand what the Mandelbrot set is, it is worth reading about it, which you can do here or by searching the web: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set

## OpenCL
OpenCL is ideal for performing parallel, iterative compute operations on graphics hardware. It actually uses 'dynamic 
parallelism', and true recursion isn't supported. Modern GPUs now have thousands of very small processors and banks of
fast, local (to the GPU) memory at various grouping levels. OpenCL is used to do the 'raw maths' part, and forms the
core of this software. 
If you are using your CPU to calculate pixel colouring using the mandelbrot algorithm, you are limited to running only as
many instances as you can have parallel threads running on the CPU cores. Because each iteration of the algorithm is
simple and not processor intensive at all, it doesn't require big processors. GPU processors are ideal. It is interesting
to see that modern CPUs contain increasingly greater numbers of cores, each core often having several effective cores 
within. The latest CPUS now include different type of cores, some which are good for intensive single-thread operations
and some which are good for simpler, more parallel workloads. With those simpler, parallel cores, the cores are working
more like the small parallel processors in GPUS. GPUs were once mainly used just for Graphics but now they are used for
all sorts of compute work as well. Some don't even provide a display output port. 

My first fractal explorer was coded in Visual Basic and then later in C#. Both versions used a CPU and were very slow, 
taking a few seconds to generate a ~4Mb bitmap. When the program was written using an OpenCL kernel and a modest
dedicated GPU, it could generate the same image in the region of 400 times faster than on the dual core CPU used. That
equates to billions of operations being completed for a fairly large (1024 x 1024) pixel map, in just a few milliseconds.

Interoperability between OpenCL and OpenGL allows the pixel image map generated by the kernel to be dsiplayed straight to
a screen, not having to be written to an image file to be opened later, which was the initial clunky method used. 
The key to understanding why an OpenCL implementation works so well for compute using the mandelbrot set, is that because
the madlebrot algorithm uses as many parallel calculations as coordinates in your display grid, each thread only requires
a very small processor, as in a GPU. The worload load is spread into 'work groups' over the thousands of tiny processors
available on modern GPU hardware. Generally speaking, when using OpenCL for similar parallel tasks, you don't need to worry
about calculating the ideal workgroup size parameter yourself, which I got bogged down with in early attempts. Vendors'
implementations do a very good job of calculating the ideal workgroup size themselves.

The kernel code compiles to the GPU itself. A memory allocation is reserved in RAM in code on your local machine and this 
is passed to the GPU memory and on to the kernel as a vector imnage map. When the kernel has done it's work and pixel
colours have been calculated, a 'swap buffer' passes the image map to the memory allocation in your code and the OpenGL 
code passes the image map to the screen.
In this code, that only happens each time a complete fractal is generated. OpenCL can be used for many parallel 
programming applications, especially those which can be highly parallel, such as in software used to generate molecular
sequences for finding possible new pharmaceutical drugs or for thermodynamics applications. 

NB: OpenCL can also run with CPU vendor API implementations, including this one, if the vendor SDK is obtained. It would
be interesting to see how fast this type of kernel can work with the latest types of CPU, with the increasing use of
more cores, each capable of running a parallel thread.

## SDL2
The interactive 'SDL2' layer listens for keypress or mouse events, allowing you to zoom in and out of a mandelbrot
rendition. There are many other possible libraries which could be used. I used SDL because it is very easy to set up and
very simple to use to intercept realtime user events. I also used glfw but found that trickier, mainly in terms of header
file versioning, among other things. There is room for adaptation here and any lightweight open source API could be used
in theory. Any speed differences between these user interaction APIs is largely irrelevant because they will all be able
to respond to user events more-or-less 'instantly'. 

## Core Code
The base program was orginally written and built using Code::Blocks IDE but the current version was written using 
Microsoft VS Code. The source codebase consists of only 2 files, 'main.cpp' and 'mandel.cl'. These are what are 
offered under the GNU license. All other information is offered only to help others to get an environment up and
running and people are advised to read about these parts themselves. All links and information are given to provide
a little help to get a fully functional, open source implementation of a mandelbrot visualisation to render to your 
screen. Please do refer to all 3rd party open source offerings for yourself, as links may cease to work and what 
little information is provided on the subject of parallel computing is very limited. The subject is huge and this code 
is offered only to help people to get started without too much fuss. 

'main.cpp' is a standard C++ file and 'mandel.cl' is an OpenCL kernel format file, which can be modified by the user
using a standard text editor to alter rendering speed, fractal appearance and complexity. The kernel performs all the 
parallel iteration sets of the Mandelbrot algorithm. The kernel is written to the Grpahics hardware at compilation time
and returns complete fractal RGBA pixel image maps at each rendition at runtime: on program start and
at each mouse-click event (zoom in / zoom out) performed by the user, via the SDL2 API. The zoom code needs work...

NB: The kernel ('mandel.cl') has a lot of room for improvisation and is by no means the most efficient code to perform
pixel colouring functions to produce image maps. In particular, the colour banding and blending is clunky and slower
than it could be. The same goes for the interactive navigation code in SDL2. The centering and zoom maths is very basic,
probably overly complicated and inefficient. Anyone who is interested is encouraged to improve upon it in their own code
and to offer suggestions for this codebase. It would be good to see that part improved upon and simplified. It seems that
this SDL code doesn't even centre correctly, so I may have messed up at some point, before commiting the repo.

What the software does provide is a tried and tested base from which mandelbrot exploration can be done without having to
worry about setting up an environment and writing all the bolier-plate code from scratch. It took me months to get the
first basic OpenCL version working many years ago, only with the eventual use of Eric Bainville's code, Hopefully the
code and info here and on Eric's homepage can help people avoid some of the hassle of going through that, to get started. 

The program could equally be run and compiled at the command line without an IDE but the extensions for VS Code make it
very easy to see what's going on during compilation using that, especillay when debugging. If running with the command
prompt, linker flags will need to be set correctly. On linux, the following should work. 
(You might have to preceed with the admin 'sudo' command, depending on your setup):

g++ main.cpp -Wall -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lOpenCL -o ../bin/main.out

If using VS Code, your project can include local config files in json format:
(launch.json/tasks.json/c_cpp_properties.json) and a VS Code workspace file. Basic versions are included, 
which work on this project in linux on my PC. 

## Compiler 
Here are some general instructions from the Visual Studio Code website for setting these up for your local
deployment using the GNU compiler / debugger (gdb/gcc) or CLang (probably best Mac and/or with OpenCL V 3.0):
* Windows (with MinGW/MinGW-w64 & gdb)  : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw
* Linux (with gdb)                      : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-linux
* Mac/OSX (with CLang compiler)         : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-clang-mac

## 3rd party requirements 
The project requires the following libraries/source/headers:
* OpenGL - Graphics rendering (may already be present by default on Linux and/or Mac OS)
* OpenCL - For Compute operations (may already be present by default on Linux and/or Mac OS)
* SDL2 - For user / screen interaction (requires runtime library install and header)
  https://www.libsdl.org/
  (SDL2 is just one of several possible 3rd party interactive layers you could use. This code does require it but could
  be modified to work with different UI libraries, such as glfw, as mentioned previously.
* SDL2_Image (optional) - For working with physical image files (requires header file include). 
  NB: This is not required unless physical images are being created from the raw image data, as in the oiriginal code.
* glu.h - OpenGL helper header file. (Usually already present in the include/GL folder)
  Installing these 3rd party dibraries will be different on different platforms. In Windows there is an SDK which can be
  installed but this may exist already on your machine in the other OS's. You can often find the open source header files
  offered on their own or as part of other open source offerings.

### OpenCL notes
The OpenCL specification is managed by Khronos Group. Khronos.org is an organisation of representatives
from many interested parties. Their homepage is here: https://www.khronos.org/
The OpenCL registry homepage is here: https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/
You can also download the specifications for OpenCL versions from that page. I printed out the OpenCL 1.2 version
on nice photo quality glossy paper. Using this, it was not hard to implement different OpenCL API calls.
NB: It is worth noting that in 2020 the specification for OpenCL 3.0 came out. This project was written
in OpenCL 1.2, which is the core on which OpenCL 3.0 is based. This code has been tested and will run using OpenCL 1.2 or
with OpenCL 3.0 when using compliant GPU hardware if you wish, where CLang compilers are reccomended by 3rd parties.
Read more about OpenCL 3.0 here: https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-group-releases-opencl-3.0
There is a working group that also guides the development of OpenCL (and SYCL):
https://www.iwocl.org/

## Vulkan
Vulkan is a new graphics api developed by AMD and Khronos Group. At the time of the early commits, my understanding was 
that parallel compute functionality was not fully mature in Vulkan. OpenCL might even still be the most direct and 
efficient api to use to do highly recursive parallel compute operations without having to write lots of bolierplate code.
I may not attempt to rewrite this code using the Vulkan API but would be interested if others do. I have gone through an
excellent Vulkan learning reference twice and still find it hard to understand at the lowest level when compared to OpenCL.
One great aspect of the Vulkan API, is that it has been adopted by the major GPU verndors and is as a result an alternative
to other vendor APIs or API wrappers. It is intersting to read about NVIDIA's CUDA and Microsoft's DirectX, OpenCL and
OpenGL and then to compare them with Vulkan across different types of implementations and different vendor hardware. 
Vulkan is increasingly being used for writing game graphics engines. The boilerplate code takes a while to write but once
done, it seems a very effifient API to use to write all sorts of graphical compute intensive software.

## Licensing 
Ths project base code is licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE version 3.0:

SDL2 and SDL_Image are made available under the zlib license: https://www.zlib.net/zlib_license.html
(Please refer to the SDL homepage for instructions and licensing)

OpenCL / OpenGL: OpenCL and OpenGL are by definition open source. However, graphics rendering / compute OpenCL capable
hardware vendors generally have their own proprietory implementations and drivers. This means that for OpenCL and OpenGL
to work with your hardware, you will often need to install graphics drivers for your OS and hardware (GPU / CPU)
You will likely already have these installed on your machine with your graphics driver vendor implementation.
Apart from the proprietory drivers, the OpenCL/OpenGL open source core header files can often be obtained independently
from the hardware vendors, if desired. Khronos Group were at the time of writing, building an OpenCL SDK in GitHUb:
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-SDK. This is offered under the Apache 2.0 license.


## Extensions for VS code
VS Code has a host of helpful extensions available. For this project, some recommended ones are below. To download them
in the terminal, copy the 'ext...' command into the terminal and press enter. Or install them by clicking on the
extensions VS Code menu item and searching from there.
* C/C++ (Cpp Tools)         : ext install ms-vscode.cpptools
* C/C++ Extension Pack      : ext install ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack
* OpenCL (author galarius)  : ext install galarius.vscode-opencl
* GitHuib Markdown Preview  : ext install bierner.github-markdown-preview


# OS specific environment setup notes

 ## WINDOWS (64-bit)
(For Win32 substitute MinGW for MinGW-64)
In windows, the project is easily developed using the MinGW-64 gcc runtime: This can be installed from the MSYS2 terminal.
Instructions here: https://www.msys2.org/
You will also need the glu library and header. GLU is likely included as part of vendor specific OS OpenGL implementations.
The library file is called 'glew32.dll' and the header file is called 'glu.h'

To install SDL2, see the following:
https://wiki.libsdl.org/SourceCode & https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation

Although probably unnecessary here, generally you should be able to download the source code (not binaries) and then
compile your own libraries with MSYS2. An example for installing glew on Windows is here (2nd post by Infinite Loop):
https://community.khronos.org/t/how-do-i-build-glew-for-mingw-w64-using-cmake-on-windows/74967/3
These instructions can be followed for other C/C++ sources.


## APPLE
On MacOS, the OpenGL and OpenCL runtimes are likely already installed.
For tweaking OpenCL header and related installs, these instructions may be useful:
    https://rageandqq.github.io/blog/2018/03/09/opencl-mac-cpp.html
    https://www.py4u.net/discuss/95798

To install SDL2 and SDL2 Image (only required for creating physical fractal images) with brew, follow instructions here:

* brew install sdl2
* brew install sdl2_image 
* OR see detailed instructions for SDL2 here: https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation#macos

## LINUX
On linux, OpenCL and SDL2 are required (SDL2 Image is optional, as above) and can be installed like this:
https://learncgames.com/tutorials/how-to-install-sdl-on-linux/

* sudo apt update
* sudo apt install ocl-icd-opencl-dev
* sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
* sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-2.0-0-dev (optional)

As stated above, GLU may or may not already exist. GLU is an older helper header file from early versions of OpenGL

Extra build args (in tasks.json):
* "-lGL",         : OpenGL
* "-lGLU",        : GLU
* "-lSDL2main",   : SDL2 main entry
* "-lSDL2",       : SDL2
* "-lSDL2_image", : SDL Image
* "-lOpenCL"      : OpenCL
